	- Add new command to bookmark all/selected visible lines
	- Allocate new margin num instead of using predefined one
	- Add "Hide Compare Margin" setting
	- Add regex ignored line portions marking

10.08.2025
v2.0.0

	- Enable multithreading in changed lines detection
	- Compare now includes also the line endings (EOL) so now it will find also mismatched EOL types
	- Added EOL ignore option
	- Added hidden lines ignore option
	- Added option to disable changed lines detection (so called sub-block diffs)
	- Added detection of sub-line moves option (moves detection within changed lines)
	- Added advanced regex ignore line portions option using Boost Regex engine for improved speed and extended
		syntax allowing complex patterns. Regex can be configured to either ignore or compare only the line portions
		matching the pattern
	- Added compare options dialog which groups all possible detect/ignore compare options
	- Added diffs visual filtering dialog which allows fine selection of diff types to be shown
	- Commands to bookmark diffs are replaced by new commands to copy/delete only visible lines
		(made to work in synergy with diffs visual filtering but usable also in the generic case when there are
		hidden lines in Notepad++ document that should not be copied/deleted)
	- Added generate patch command (produces unified diff type patch file)
	- Added apply patch command (can be used on the old file of a comparison to produce the new file)
	- Added revert patch command that reverts the result of apply patch. Can also be used on the new file of a
		comparison to produce the old file BUT this might not always work if patch had been generated from compare
		that had some ignore options enabled due to a possibly mismatching contexts
	- Compared files views synchronization speed is increased reducing scroll lag and making it more responsive
	- Report if there are ignored differences between files when those are considered matching
	- Added setting configuring if warning about big size files comparison is to be shown
	- Removed the setting to align all matching lines - those will always be aligned now
	- Increased font size in dialogs for improved visibility on high DPI displays
	- Plugin's menu updated and reordered
	- Plugin's About dialog now prints current libraries versions, author's e-mail link is removed
	- Update Notepad++ and Scintilla plugin API headers and ensure compatibility
	- Update SQLite3 library to v3.50.3
	- Several minor corner-case bug fixes and some optimizations

	- Has also ARM64 build (except the SVN diff command that depends on external library which doesn't have ARM64 variant)
